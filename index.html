      <h1 id="intro"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h1>
      <h4>This website is made to inform and give a brief overview on the Vietnamese boat people. The Vietnamese boat people were part of an immensely large wave of migration fleeing from the Fall of Saigon in the Vietnam War, which ended in 1975. The North Vietnamese had taken over South, and desperate ideas came into mind, therefore, people started evacuating from Vietnam in cramped boats immigrating to anywhere except Vietnam. Despite the high death toll, many Vietnamese did make it to refugee camps established around South-East Asia, and then transported to various countries by plane. The first arrival to Australia was a boatload on the 26th of April, 1976.</h4>

      <h1 id="journey"><b>The Journey</b></h1>
       <p>
        After the conclusion of the Vietnam War and the victory of a Vietnamese communist regime, 2 million South Vietnamese people escaped Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos following as the communist regime spread across the region. Cambodia sunk into the cruel Khmer Rouge rule. The chance of survival once in boat was scarce, and seldom did boats have enough resources and boat strength to travel all the way to North Australia. Enormous refugee camps along the border of Thailand were set up. The boats themselves though were a different matter. Unseaworthy fishing vessels they were, overcrowded and scarce on resources, either being sunken to storms or even downed in calm seas by the sinking of leaky boats. On top of everything, pirates usually attacked ships and raped the women and scraped off the valuables. During that time, the people of Laos and Cambodia also fled their country in fear of the communism and the Khmer Rouge, and over 10 years from 1976, Australia received 94,000 refugees from Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam and as of 2016's census, 219,357 Vietnamese-born people live in Australia. But not all wanted the refugees. In 1979, Malaysia announced that any refugees arriving in the country would be shot, and they were true to their word, in June 1979, Malaysia set 2500 Vietnamese back to sea adrift.

        <h1 id="cr"><b>Crisis and Response</b></h1>
         <p>
          Prior to the arrival of the Vietnamese boat people, Australia had not taken kindly to non-White people immigrating to Australia. In fact, migrants had to pass a dictation test in any European language in order to enter Australia between 1901 and 1958 as part of the Immigration Restriction Act. However, Australia started to take more kindly towards non-European humans, as of the outcome of the Racial Discrimination Act in 1975, just at the end of the Vietnam War. As this huge wave of migration caught the eye of nations worldwide, in an international negotiation, Australia promised to take in an increased number of refugees, only if the South- East Asians stopped redirecting boats in dire need. Therefore, the Australian government sent officials around the vast continent of Asia to the refugee camps, swarming with refugees. When the officials were there, they would handpick certain refugees who would be given a visa, which is an official document that allows the bearer to legally enter a foreign country. By the time that Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser lost the government to Bob Hawke in 1983, Australia took more than 15,000 refugees per year. However, this broke many of Australia&#39;s traditional ties with Britain, forged new links with Asia.         </p>
